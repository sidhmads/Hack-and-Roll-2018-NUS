**React Native**
* There is a matlab code to convert *.wav* format to *.coe* format. This will be used to produce the music on *xilinx fpga basys3*
* The app communicates with *arduino* via the use of *HC-05* bluetooh module. There is a slider, which can be used to control the degree of opening and closing of the smart window. There is also a component to read the sensorical datas from the arduino and print it on the screen. Finally there is also a datetime picker, which is used to schedule the opening or closing of the arduino respectively.
