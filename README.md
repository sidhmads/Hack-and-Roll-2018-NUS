# Hack-and-Roll-2018-NUS

**Hack and Roll 2018**
* It is a 24 hours Hackathon organsied by the NUS Hackers. Approximately 500 people turned up for this event to hack!

**Our Project** 
* There are numerous occassions where we have our windows open while we are out. When it is not raining, it is totally fine. However, when it starts raining, 
our rooms get wet and at times filled with water.
* In this project, my Team and I planned on making a automated window opener and closer. 
* This project mainly had 3 components
	1) React Native App
	2) Arduino Programming
	3) Bluetooth Connection 
* I was soley incharge of the react native app programming and also helped out in Arduino Programming too.

**React Native**
* The app communicates with *arduino* via the use of *HC-05* bluetooh module on the arduino and the Android Native App. 
* There is a slider, which can be used to control the degree of opening and closing of the smart window. 
* There is also a component to read the sensorical datas from the arduino and print it on the screen. 
* Finally there is also a datetime picker, which is used to schedule the opening or closing of the arduino respectively.

**Arduino** 
* The project was built on *Arduino Mega, Bluetooth Sensor, Humidity Sensor, Pressure Sensor, Altitude Sensor, Temperture Sensor and DIY Rain Sensor.

**In the future**
* Scheduling function update
